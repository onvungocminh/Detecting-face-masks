# COVID-19: Detecting face masks

This project is implemented to detect face mask by using OpenCV, Keras and Tensorflow.
We build a model to train face mask detector.
There are 2 steps:
- In the first step, we train a model to classify mask and non-mask face
- In the second step, we detect facial region in the image then verify if this person is wearing mask or not.
